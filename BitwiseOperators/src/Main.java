/* 
 * Bitwise operators work on binary digits or bits of input values. 
 * We can apply these to the integer types â€“  long, int, short, char, and byte.

 * How and when to use bitwise operators in Java article:
 * https://www.quora.com/How-and-when-to-use-bitwise-operator-in-Java
 * 
 * Some potential use cases of bitwise operators are:

    Communication stacks where the individual bits in the header attached to the data signify important information
    In embedded systems to set/clear/toggle just one single bit of a specific register without modifying the remaining bits
    To encrypt data for safety issues using the XOR operator
    In data compression by converting data from one representation to another, to reduce the amount of space used

		 * operators, as it can be achieved by performing a signed left shift followed
		 * by a bitwise AND operation with the desired bitmask 0xFFFFFFFF (representing
		 * 32 bits set to 1). This effectively clears the sign bit that would have been
		 * set by the signed left shift, resulting in an equivalent effect to an
